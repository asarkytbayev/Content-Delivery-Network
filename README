DNS Server:  

For this milestone, I've implemented a basic DNS server. The code is going to be tested  
out using the url cs5700.example.com. I wasn't able to find this website, so my DNS server  
simple sets the qr = 1, indicating a response, aa = 1, meaning that my server is authoratitive,  
and finally rcode = 3, which means that domain doesn't exist.

How to run the server:  
./dnsserver -p 40006 -n url  
  
How to test:  
dig cs5700cdn.example.com @192.168.0.118 -p 40006
